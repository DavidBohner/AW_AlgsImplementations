# ArtikulationsKnotenSuche

Implements (Tarjan's) algorithm, not introduced as such in the lecture, on an undirected connected graph.

## Current functionality:
Before you can use ArtikulationsKnotenSuche.search(Graph graph), you must first build the graph you wish to search on, which you can then pass to the method.
ArtikulationsKnotenSuche.search(Graph graph) will return a HashSet containing all the nodes that are Biconnected Components / Artikulationsknoten.

_ArtikulationsKnotenSucheTest.testSearch() has a working implementation within it._

## To-Do:
